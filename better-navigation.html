									<h3 class="major">Navigating when you can't see</h3>
									<p>
                                        <span class="image left"><img src="images/wsu_map.png" alt="" /></span>Navigating when you're blind isn't easy, especially when you're in an unfamiliar place.
                                        While mobile phones show promise as a potential aid to the blind, most current navigation apps were not developed for the blind.
                                        Digital solutions like Google Maps suffer severely from missed turns and lack of specificity in the instructions.
                                    </p>
									<p>
                                        The Better Navigation app changes that. Using clock-based directions, the app is able to give the user-specific and concise instructions.
                                        "Go 10 o'clock in about 12 steps" is much clearer than "turn left in 9 meters."
                                        During testing with blindfolded users, the Better Navigation app helped the users get to their destination about 16% faster than when using Google Maps - and
                                        that number doesn't account for critical assists. What are critical assists? When navigating, some of the users strayed so far off the route
                                        that we had to step in and take them back to the right path. This happened at least once for each user when using Google Maps,
                                        but only once for one user while testing our app.
                                    </p>

									<h3 class="major">What's next?</h3>

                                        <span class="image right"><img src="images/phone.jpg" alt="" /></span>Right now, the Better Navigation app is being merged into another app: CityGuide.
                                        CityGuide is an app that also supports indoor navigation for the blind when used in conjuction with Bluetooth beacons placed throughout a building.
                                        It is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2017.7917858">currently under development</a> by a graduate student as Wichita State University.
